### Project #3
Timeline: 2024.1.12 - 2024.1.28


The start of this project was incredibly frustrating. I struggled to get certain modules to work, spending days debugging almost without any progress. At times, I wanted to quit and move on to another project. However, I decided to see it through to the end. 

Eventually, stars aligned, and I resolved all the problems with modules, which allowed me to continue and finish the project.

At the end, I gained some resistance to frustration, debugging skills, animation, working with classes.
